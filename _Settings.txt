#this file is here for the user to edit and experiment with different variables that will affect the output of the simulation

# the higher this is, the longer it will take nations to break apart (should be in between 1-5)
DefaultStability: 2
# how much income/tax each nation gets per development (originally 0.5)
IncomePerDevelopment: 0.9


# this is the coeficiant of a polynomial function f(x) = StateMaintenance * (x^2), where x is the amount of states the nation owns
# A nation needs to pay f(x) amount of state maintenance every turn (originally 0.1)
StateMaintenance: 0.1

# same function for army maintenance as well (originally 0.1)
armyMaintenance: 0.1
